Sony TV Web Page Remote Control - Web Extension

## Web Extension

This is a web page based Sony TV Remote Control.

It requires manual installation as a web extension (Add-On).

This extension as shipped has a few hardcoded channels and buttons that may not be useful to everyone.
The web page can be edited as needed by downloading the entire web extension locally and editing it as needed.

The extension can then be loaded from the local directory.

For example, in Firefox: visit the about:debugging page and then in [Add-ons] use the [Load Temporary Add-on] button and select any file in the folder where this extension is stored. In Chrome, visit [More Tools] [Extensions] and use the [Local unpacked extension...] command.
(<em>This has only been tested on Firefox</em>.)

After the Add-on extension is loaded, it will display a television icon on the browser toolbar.
Clicking on the icon will bring up the Sony TV Web Page Remote controls along with the Setup and Help tabs.

For screenshots of the extension web page, visit the home page:
